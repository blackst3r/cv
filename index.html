## 🏆 Competition Achievement

**WorldQuant Brain** @ [WorldQuant Quantitative Contest](https://www.worldquant.com/home/) <br>
  - Developed approximately 20 factors with Sharpe ratios exceeding 1.25 and turnover rates under 70%
  - Translated several factors (those with Sharpe above 2) to the A-share market, utilizing the open-source Tushare software package for data acquisition and establishing a single-factor model testing framework to compute factor performance
  - Integrated all factors exceeding a Sharpe ratio of 1 to develop a machine learning LGB model and a deep learning Transformer model. This was performed using A-share data from 2015 to 2019, with back testing from 2020 to 2022, resulting in annualized returns of 49% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.58.
